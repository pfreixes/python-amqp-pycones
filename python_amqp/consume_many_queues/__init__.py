Consume Many queues tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consume many queues tests runs each different design patterns implemented to consume
one amount of messages from many queues where each queue has the same number of messages, and
for each one the total, user and system time are collected to face all of them.

All AMQP entites are created before the all tests are executed and destroyed them when all tests
have been exeucted. The messages are published each time that one test is run and purgued after
one test has finished.

All tests are implemented as child class of `ConsumeManyQueuesBase`, this class implements the
common operations used by the tests.
